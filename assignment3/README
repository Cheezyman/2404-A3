This project simulates a basic cell phone network. It includes classes for cell phones, towers, messages, and a network to manage interactions between them. The simulation handles message routing, tracking cell phone locations, and managing message histories.

Project Structure
The project is divided into several components:

CellPhone: Represents a cell phone with a unique ID, location, and message history.
Tower: Represents a network tower with a unique ID, location, and message history.
Message: Represents a message with a sender, receiver, and the message content.
Network: Manages the cell phones and towers, routes messages, and handles cell phone movements.
Entity: A base class for CellPhone and Tower, containing common attributes and methods.
List: A custom list implementation for managing message histories.
Location: Represents a geographical location.
Key Features
Message Routing: The network routes messages between cell phones via the closest towers.
Location Tracking: Each cell phone and tower has a location, which is used for routing messages.
Message History: Both cell phones and towers maintain a history of messages.
Dynamic ID Assignment: Cell phones and towers have unique IDs, which are dynamically assigned.
Compilation and Execution
To compile and run the project, ensure you have a C++ compiler installed. Navigate to the project directory and use the following commands:
make
./a3

Usage
After running the simulation, you can:

Add cell phones and towers to the network.
Move cell phones to different locations.
Send messages between cell phones.
View message histories of cell phones and towers.
Reset IDs of cell phones and towers.
